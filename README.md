Hey,

Thanks for looking at my assessment. Being honest it was quite tricky to jump back into PHP right away,
but it's also fun to work with it again. Regarding the solutions I think it's decent, but could be better for sure. I believe with a bit of practice and doing some tasks it'll be easy to pick it up again. 
Also this assessment didn't include any frontend, which is where most my strenghts are at the moment, so perhaps this other assessment (see below) in Vue would give you an idea. This is a sort of Netflix clone and also build in a couple hours. 

If there's any questions and remarks regarding this assessment I'll gladly discuss them.

Thanks, 
Jorrit
